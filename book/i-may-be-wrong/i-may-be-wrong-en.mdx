## I was believing every thought that came to mind.

Up until now, I've believed that every thought in my head comes from me.

Letting go of the past and future and focusing on the present.

This book is worth the price of admission just to learn how to live in a state of conscious presence, that is, fully aware of the now.
Of course, you don't have to be in the present forever. You need to relax a little bit.

Success does not guarantee happiness.

I can see why meditation focuses on breathing.
Our bodies live in the present by breathing, and by focusing on that survival activity, our minds are able to be present as well.
