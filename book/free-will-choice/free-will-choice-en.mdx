<Callout reference="Tsukuru Tazaki and the year he went on a pilgrimage without color">
  I've been thinking lately, I'm living my life, of course, but almost everything that happens in it has nothing to do with me.
  In other words, I seem to be living with free will at first glance.
  but maybe I don't get to choose what really matters.
</Callout>

This is how I felt when I was reading the book. I feel like I'm living my life with free will, but when it comes to choosing important crossroads in my life, I don't know what I'm choosing. I wondered why I felt that way. Then, for the first time, as I saw the wider world and met various people, I thought seriously about my life. What do I want to do in this world, what can I do, and what can I do in this world. I asked myself endless questions. How many people can answer these questions in the first place? I'm still searching for answers that I can't find. But lately, I've been focusing on the journey to find those answers. So a little bit of the (still ineffable) reason for living can be felt in the time I spend with my loved ones, in the books I read in bits and pieces on the train, and in the time and space I spend pouring my heart into the people I love.

Of course, I still can't say that I'm any closer to the right answer than I was four years ago.
